For a successful compilation, **you need a MinGW installation and special libraries (OpenGL, GLFW, PNG and etc.)**
I just give a link to my MinGW folder, **it should be thrown into the MinGW root folder**.
(By default it is located in 'C:\MinGW\*', but it may be different for you)

Run **build.bat** for build the project.
